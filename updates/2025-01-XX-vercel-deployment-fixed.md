# 2025-01-XX - Vercel Deployment Configuration Fixed

**Type**: ðŸ”§ Technical Update  
**Status**: âœ… Completed  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Date**: January 2025

## Overview

Fixed Vercel deployment configuration to properly serve React static files and resolve 404 errors that were preventing the website from loading correctly in production.

## Problem Identified

The website was experiencing 404 errors for CSS and JavaScript files:
- `GET https://www.race4success.org/static/js/main.521fdde4.js net::ERR_ABORTED 404`
- `GET https://www.race4success.org/static/css/main.e496cfaf.css net::ERR_ABORTED 404`

## Root Cause

The Vercel configuration was not properly set up to:
1. Build the React application during deployment
2. Serve the React build files correctly
3. Handle static asset routing properly

## Changes Made

### Vercel Configuration (`vercel.json`)
- **Updated to**: Use `@vercel/static-build` for React builds
- **Configured**: `distDir` to point to React build folder
- **Simplified**: Routing to serve React app directly
- **Removed**: Complex routing that was causing conflicts

### Package Configuration (`package.json`)
- **Added**: `homepage` field for proper asset paths
- **Ensured**: `vercel-build` script points to React build

### Build Process
- **Verified**: React build generates correct static files
- **Confirmed**: CSS and JS files are properly created
- **Tested**: Local build process works correctly

## Technical Details

### Before (Problematic Configuration)
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "server.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    },
    {
      "src": "public/**",
      "use": "@vercel/static"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/css/(.*)",
      "dest": "/public/css/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```

### After (Fixed Configuration)
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "build"
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Files Modified

- `vercel.json` - Updated deployment configuration
- `package.json` - Added homepage field for asset paths

## Build Verification

### React Build Output
```

File sizes after gzip:
  52.46 kB  build\static\js\main.521fdde4.js
  2.26 kB   build\static\css\main.e496cfaf.css

### Static Files Generated
- `build/static/js/main.521fdde4.js` âœ…
- `build/static/css/main.e496cfaf.css` âœ…
- `build/index.html` âœ…
- `build/asset-manifest.json` âœ…

## Issues Resolved

- âœ… **404 Errors**: CSS and JS files now load correctly
- âœ… **Static Assets**: Proper serving of React build files
- âœ… **Deployment**: Successful Vercel deployment process
- âœ… **Asset Paths**: Correct relative paths for all assets

## Result

Successful deployment with:
- **CSS Loading**: All stylesheets load correctly
- **JavaScript Loading**: React app initializes properly
- **Asset Serving**: Static files served from correct locations
- **Performance**: Optimized production build deployed

## Impact

- **User Experience**: Website now loads completely without errors
- **Performance**: Optimized React build served efficiently
- **Reliability**: Consistent deployment process
- **Maintainability**: Clear deployment configuration

This fix ensures Race4Success.org loads correctly for all visitors with all assets properly served by Vercel's CDN.
